Additionally, I also like that good work is often rewarded. Quality pays off - just like in craftsmanship. Those who work foresightedly and modernly will be rewarded in the future, in terms of system support. That's why I myself rely on modern web technologies and tools. I constantly strive to improve my quality and use as few external libraries as necessary. Vanilla JS and custom LESS-CSS / SASS-CSS are the best methods for me when it comes to minimal applications. In addition, JavaScript frameworks like NextJS, Vue, and Svelte are also super interesting for scalable applications."

Further development of smart home technology is also a very exciting topic for me. {{Break}}{{Break}} The COVID-19 pandemic made many digitalization issues clearly visible - as a result, many things have already been steered in the right direction.
