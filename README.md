# kobydotdev

This is my personal website, built with next.js and deployed on Vercel.
I am using this website and the repository to learn more about next.js and to try out new things.
That's why the code is not perfect and I am still working on it, but I am happy to get feedback and suggestions. 🙏

The current state of the website is not deployed yet, but you can find the old website here: [koby.dev](https://koby.dev).

Have a nice day! 🌞
